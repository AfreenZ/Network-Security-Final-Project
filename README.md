# Network-Security-Final-Project
Here is my final project for a Network Security course I took in Fall 2023.

Here is an outline of this project:
1a - 1b. Implementation of a Secure Key Exchange Application using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm 

1c. User1 uses LSFR to generate a key and shares it to User2 using an RSA algorithm

2a. Implementing a secure messaging application using a stream cipher

2b. Implementing a secure messaging application using an AES algorithm in ECB and CBC

2c. Implementing a secure messaging application using DES and evaluate under ECB and CBC

3a - 3d. Creating a digital signature demonstration so Users 1 and 2 can authenticate the identity of each other by implementing RSA
